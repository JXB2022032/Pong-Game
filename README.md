• Create a Java-based Pong game that is engaging and user-friendly. The game is two-player mode in which the two paddles are controlled by Keyboard input W/S, and Up/Down arrows key.

• This program has incorporated the physics of a ball bouncing off walls or paddles. The speed of the ball will progressively increase with each hit, and the direction of the bounce will be randomized.

• A scoring system on the top, one point awarded for each successful hit on the opponent's side. The score will display at the top of the screen.
